# SEGMED IMAGE GALLERY


### Setup

This part has been made as easy as possible.
I have built binaries for all major platforms and systems architecture
So all that's needed is to: 

1. navigate through the production folder and copy the appropriate main binary to the home folder and 


2. Run ```./main``` on the terminal

E.g: On Mac go to production/darwin/amd64 copy the file 'main' to the project home directory where we have other asset folders and run ./main

Same for Linux, Windows, Android, etc.

Please ignor the Dockerfile as I had local installation issues and is still a work in progress.
Could not get it fixed in time for the deadline.

Alternatively a working copy of this app is running on my private server
